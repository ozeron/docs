## Billing overview

You pay only for the compute time you actually use. Every sandbox session accrues credits for active CPU cores and the RAM it keeps allocated, billed to the second. When a sandbox stops, billing stops too.


## Pricing model

- **Compute credits**: Subscription plans (\$10 Hobby, \$50 Pro) include monthly pools of credits. \$1.00 worth of credits equals 1,000,000 units.
- **vCPU usage**: Each vCPU-second consumes 7 credits, giving you transparent per-second pricing.
- **RAM usage**: Each gigabyte-second consumes 2.25 credits, so you can scale memory without surprises.
- **Token packs**: Need a short-lived burst? Add 100,000 credits for \$1.00 with no commitment.
- **Concurrency**: Plan limits keep teams within budgetâ€”Free users can run up to 3 sandboxes, Hobby up to 10, and Pro up to 100 simultaneously.

## Current rates

| Meter | USD / second | USD / hour | USD / 30-day month* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vCPU (per core) | $0.000007 | $0.0252 | $18.40 |
| RAM (per GB) | $0.00000225 | $0.0081 | $5.91 |

<Note>
  *Monthly estimates assume 730 hours (average month). Actual charges reflect precise runtime.
</Note>

## Plan allowances

- **Free**: 1,000,000 credits/month, up to 3 concurrent sandboxes, 10 sandbox tokens monthly.
- **Hobby ($10/month)**: 10,000,000 credits/month, 10 concurrent sandboxes.
- **Pro ($50/month)**: 50,000,000 credits/month, 100 concurrent sandboxes.

Plan items map directly to Autumn products in `server/autumn.config.ts`, so changing plan instantly updates the allowances that the API enforces during sandbox creation and timeout extensions.

<Tip>
  Custom sandboxes with dedicated hardware profiles are coming soon. Reach out if you need higher memory, GPU options, or reserved capacity.
